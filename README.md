# Notify

**Notify** is a simple notification service built in Go that uses RabbitMQ for asynchronous message processing and retries.

It is designed to offload message handling from the main server to a queue, where concurrent workers process notifications in the background. This improves scalability and fault tolerance.

## ‚ú® Features

* Built using Golang with standard library

* Uses goroutines for concurrent execution of sending notifications

* Fully Dockerized with RabbitMQ services included

* Implements exponential backoff retry queues (10s ‚Üí 30s ‚Üí 60s)

* Dead-Letter-Queue for handling messages that have exceeded max-retries and failed (Logs to a file)

* Unit tests with mock (via Testify) for most of the internal logic

* Sends emails using `net/smtp` via an abstracted `EmailSender` interface

* Includes load tests via `k6` in `load_test.js`

* Includes basic integration testing for the flow

* Features a simple HTTP DLQ Store inspector that you can use to list messages that were previously in the DLQ and requeue them if needed by the messageId (Uses persistent DB (Postgres) for storing the failed messages)

It currently consists of two main files:

* `cmd/consumer/consumer.go`: This is an HTTP server that exposes a /notify endpoint.
When a request is made to this endpoint with an email and message, the server publishes the notification to the RabbitMQ queue.

* `cmd/producer/producer.go`: This is the consumer application.
It reads messages from the queue and uses multiple concurrent workers to process and send the notifications asynchronously.

* `cmd/dlqstore/dlqstore.go`: Inspector server to list/requeue failed messages from Postgres

## üöÄ Usage

### üì¶ Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker up --build
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual

#### Copy the .env.test and add the missing fields
```bash
cp .env.test .env
```

#### To start the consumer
```bash
go run cmd/consumer/consumer.go
```

#### To start the producer
```bash
go run cmd/producer/producer.go
```

#### Make sure the RabbitMQ instance is running, if not:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:4-management
```
### üß™ Testing
```bash
go test ./...
```
All core components are covered by unit tests with mock logic for external dependencies.

### üì¨ API Endpoint
`POST /notify`

Request
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "message": "Hello from Notify!",
  "subject": "Hello"
}
```
### üõ† DLQ Inspector API
The DLQ Inspector is an optional module that lets you list or requeue messages that failed permanently and were stored in PostgreSQL.

`GET /inspect`
Lists the most recent messages in the DLQ (max: 10 messages).

Response
``` json
[
  {
    "ID": "ea003472-becf-4347-865b-e7a5d19099c0",
    "Headers": {
      "x-death": [
        {
          "count": 1,
          "exchange": "",
          "queue": "notification",
          "reason": "rejected",
          "routing-keys": ["notification"],
          "time": "xxx"
        }
      ],
      "x-first-death-exchange": "",
      "x-first-death-queue": "notification",
      "x-first-death-reason": "rejected",
      "x-last-death-exchange": "",
      "x-last-death-queue": "notification",
      "x-last-death-reason": "rejected"
    },
    "Payload": "{\"email\": \"xxx@gmail.com\", \"message\": \"xxx!\", \"subject\": \"xxx\"}",
    "Type": "",
    "Raw": null
  }
  ...
]
```

`POST /requeue`
Requeues a message from the DLQ back into RabbitMQ for reprocessing.


Request
``` json
{
  "messageId": "message-uuid-1"
}
```
